# Zenith ZT-1

The Zenith ZT-1 was a device that came out around 1981 that looked like a keyboard. It was designed to be used by someone who wanted to connect to online services via the internal 300 baud modem without the need of a computer. You would connect a composite video monochrome monitor and and interface with it via an internal menu structure held in ROM.

The system uses a Intel 8031 MCU as the main CPU, it has 8K of ROM on two 2732 ICs (dumped), 1K of SRAM (via two 2114 chips), a single 2Kx8 6116 SRAM likely used as video RAM and a 2K Chargen EPROM (2516.) An Intel CRTC is used to generate the video sync and timing. The system also has a NiCD battery that can leak which appears to be used to save phone numbers and settings to a single 2114 SRAM.

This can be considered a WebTV but in 1981.
